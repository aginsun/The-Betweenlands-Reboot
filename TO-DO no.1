To-do no.1

First of all, get the mod set up obviously.
Once that is done, the portal system should be added.
Code in - The 4 Swamp Talisman Pieces and the Swamp Talisman (this is used to light the portal)
          The Dark Druids (try to use as much of the old code as you can, but finish the mob by adding drops, sounds, and GLOWING EYES!!
          The Swamp Alter - It has a fancy model with a floating rock animation and glow effect. When right clicked the GUI comes up. The 4 small slots are where you put the Swamp Talisman Pieces, and the Swamp Talisman is then crafted in the middle.
          The Standing Stones - They look like regular stone (and drop regular stone), but some have a side with a rune texture on and they glow.
          The Druid Circle - This is the structure that Mark started. I gens in Swamp Biomes, a little common.
          The Portal - Constructed out of mossy cobble, and the portal block itself has custom animation, sounds, and particles. It is lit with the Swamp Talisman.
          Once this is done, wait for me and I will give you directions on how to make a cool lil' preview video ;)
